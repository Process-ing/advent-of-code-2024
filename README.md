# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

Repository with my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) :bowtie:

## 💝 Run Instructions

To compile and execute my code, use the `run.sh` script provided in this repository, with the day desired specified in the `-d` flag. The script will automatically pass the respective day input to the program, stored in the folder `./input/dayDD` (not included to protect [Eric Wastl's intellectual property](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_copying)), but you can also specify a custom input file with the `-i` flag.

```bash
./run.sh -d <day>             # Run day solution
./run.sh -d <day> -i <input>  # Run day solution with custom input
```
